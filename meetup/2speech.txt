They would like to do things on their own, but they often need assistance or find barriers and

"Man, I forgot to get that lettuce on the supermarket.

But this is where the Bionik exoskeleton comes in.
The ARKE exoskeleton is a lower body exoskeleton that gives people their independence back.
Through sensors and algorithms, it is able to learn and anticipate an individual's
walking pattern. Then, it uses motors to replace the function of muscles and create movement.
